In the `issuerRef` block of your `Certificate`s you can now reference
the cluster CA:

    apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
    kind: Certificate
    metadata:
      name: cert
    spec:
      ...
      issuerRef:
        name: {{ include "cluster-ca.fullname" . }}-ca
        kind: ClusterIssuer
        group: cert-manager.io
